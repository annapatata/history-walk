HistoryWalk is an interactive app designed to help you learn Athens' history by walking through its streets, with the help of Milo the curious fox. In this demo version, the user can:
-Sign up with email/password
-Select their preferences on Historical Time Periods and the time they have available for walking 
-The "Routes" page shows all the available routes with details concerning: rating by other users' reviews, the stops of the route, the difficulty, the duration and the time period. The user can apply filters to see routes that match a specific Time Period, a specific duration and/or a specific difficulty.
- When the user presses on a route box on the Routes Page, they see details about it including an introductory text by Milo , photos from the reviews of other users and the actual reviews. The "START ROUTE" button is prominent and changes to "WRITE A REVIEW" is a user completes the route and to "UPDATE YOUR REVIEW" if the user has completed the route and written a review. 
-The (non-route selected) "Map" page shows a preview of all the routes drawn like metro lines, from where , by cliking on a line, the user can also start a route.

The user can exit the route anytime by pressing the END ROUTE button. When the user reaches the last stop of the Route and press finish, they collect points and badges, as seen on the "Profile" Page.
